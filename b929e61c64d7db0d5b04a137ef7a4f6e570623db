      "message": "Thanks Emma for workign on this.  I don\u0027t think this is needed at all as even on older Operating Systems with python 3.6 (CentOS 8/8s) we shoudn\u0027t be installing a \"master\" version of tempest even inside a venv.\n\nGiven the tension between pinning tempest and introducing a potential gate blocker for any project that gates with CentOS and the complexity of handling multiple python interpeters the former is the least invasive approach.\n\n+1 for the dedication to see a job to the end, -1 because this chnage isn\u0027t needed",
