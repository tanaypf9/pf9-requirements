      "message": "I tend to disagree here. With the current state of the requirements project, bot generated updates get merged maybe twice a year if you\u0027re lucky, I wouldn\u0027t suggest to wait for that. The etcd3 project page on pypi also states that it supports a maximum of py3.6, so IMO there cannot be any reasonable use of it in any current project.\n\nWhat we could do is rebase https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/requirements/+/900435 on top of this and include the removal from u-c there, but to me it makes more sense to bundle it together here.",
