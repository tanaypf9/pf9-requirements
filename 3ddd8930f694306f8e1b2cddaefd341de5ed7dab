      "message": "As discussed in the IRC channel, it seems weird that on one hand gnocchi choose to move out of openstack governance, while on the other hand now requirements should adopt the upper bounds it introduces due to being badly maintained.\n\nThere have been other solutions proposed like installing gnocchi in a dedicated environment or maybe even container, which I would prefer to be pursued first.",

Seeing that gnocchi is already working to introduce the next version pin https://github.com/gnocchixyz/gnocchi/pull/1354 , I still think looking into doing a separate installation for it would likely be worthwhile.\n\nNote also that a pin as proposed here causes a lot of maintenance effort as it has to be manually kept in place for every weekly requirements update.",
