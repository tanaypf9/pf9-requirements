Seeing that gnocchi is already working to introduce the next version pin https://github.com/gnocchixyz/gnocchi/pull/1354 , I still think looking into doing a separate installation for it would likely be worthwhile.\n\nNote also that a pin as proposed here causes a lot of maintenance effort as it has to be manually kept in place for every weekly requirements update.",
