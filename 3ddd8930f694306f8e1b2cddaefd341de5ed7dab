However, that decision has been made ages ago and nobody here in telemetry was active at that time (in telemetry); people involved in telemetry back then are no longer involved.\n\nThere was a regression introduced in pyparsing https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing/issues/504 that is hitting gnocchi.
