      "message": "so what will happen when dnspython 2.1.0 is released? (2.1.0rc is available[1]). The eventlet, since 0.26.1, restricts the dnspython version to \u003c 2.0.0 [2]. So if we keep eventlet constraint as is, and dnspython as is then when dnspython 2.1.0 is released we will have conflicting requirements.\n\n[1] https://github.com/rthalley/dnspython/commit/a282788b29258a2dda582e7ce17583dca61fa8cf\n[2] https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet/blob/a745d62a932d7776fb9431a6fa74171c41d23450/setup.py#L18",
