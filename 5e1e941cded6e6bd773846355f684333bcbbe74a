      "message": "Actually does 1.1.9 work for stable/juno?  Given 2b10c7b51081306b4c675046fd7dfe9df375943d which sets the minimum oslo.config in DOA to 1.6.0, and g-r stable/juno has oslo.config\u003e\u003d1.4.0,\u003c\u003d1.6.0, I was wondering if DOA 1.1.9 even works in stable/juno if you had oslo.config\u003c1.6.0.  Maybe it doesn\u0027t matter since people could move up from oslo.config\u003c1.6.0 to 1.6.0 for stable/juno if necessary.",
