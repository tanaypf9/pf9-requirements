So it\u0027s possible the dependency was added before the job, then the job let it stay, and now you\u0027re modifying a requirements file and the job wants everything tidied up\n\nThis sounds right, because the requirement has been there forever.\n\nPassing job: https://review.openstack.org/528980\n\nFailing jobs: https://review.openstack.org/604205 and https://review.openstack.org/555487 (until I made them depend on this change).",
