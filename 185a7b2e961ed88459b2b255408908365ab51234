      "message": "\"which is more limited to json\" seems invalid because json-schema library works against python variables, not json input data.\nOn Nova, json-schema library works against the de-serialized variables after the de-serializer. So we can use json-schema for XML input also if both de-serialized variables are the same.\n\nI had this kind of points before, maybe the name of json-schema is not so good..",

People should be free to use whichever one suites there need (both seem to be capable); because any attempt at data validation is better than no attempt at all...",
