How tightly coupled are networking-bagpipe and networking-bgpvpn?  If they\u0027re very tightly coupled, for the near term, it might be better to use the approach used in other networking-* projects (like I80eabaf859aabb3a440f4ef2e95a4d779b2286c1)",

That was important to not have too long test runs (cloning these repos is heavy).\n\nWe hadn\u0027t find the need for a small repo like networking-bagpipe, but indeed we can nevertheless apply the same approach for this test dependency.\n\nWe will have to do it in both our master and our stable/* branches, or the requirement checks will not be effective in these branches.",
