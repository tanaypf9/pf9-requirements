      "message": "No, I disagree: other packages use it unconstrained, which means that they are using a much newer version. \nSo the version should be at least the last one, but that would break cinder anyway if https://review.openstack.org/#/c/509755/ is applied. So no point in fixing it just for cinder if most users of pylint are happy being unconstrained.",
