I started doing it (for example: https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/requirements/+/900564/1?usp\u003drelated-change) but I stopped as it was manual and I figured I\u0027d wait for this to \"go green\" and then do it.  Either via squashing or a seperate change.\n\nAs I said in a comment to Sean I\u0027m not convinced that the more human friendly format is needed, but that\u0027s something to be discussed as I get closer with implmenting this new process as a job.",
