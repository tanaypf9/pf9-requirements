      "message": "honestly, I disagree. stable/kilo has shipped, it\u0027s in the field. Deciding that we cap stable/kilo later only helps for people that upgrade stable/kilo to that point, which might, itself, trigger a downgrade.\n\nAll this rule does is create an unrealistic sandbox environment and stick our fingers in our ears about how people\u0027s environments are going to end up in the field.",

      "message": "@Sean - certainly, thats one way to argue it. However lets look a bit more closely - consider the pattern from liberty on, where we have published known-good for everything (upper-constraints.txt).\n\nFolk installing can be bucketed:\n - devstack\n - custom PyPI/git based CD deployment\n - binary RPM/dpkg etc deployment\n - other non-PyPI\n\ndevstack will be insulated - if we prevent downgrades, it won\u0027t get into constraints, and devstack in liberty on uses constraints.\n\na custom set of tooling can utilise constraints if they wish - and one of the themes around our dependencies is signalling what works - so I certainly hope folk do use it\n\nbinary RPM etc deployments are fundamentally more curated than our experience w/devstack, but again - the packages look to our requirements files and constraints files for guidance\n\nSo I see this more as avoiding handing out bad advice, not making an unrealistic sandbox.",
