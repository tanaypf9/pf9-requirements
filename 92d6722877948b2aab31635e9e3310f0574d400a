      "message": "So i admit to cheating here a little to keep the tests working. Both version and extras are parsed into a set by pkg_resources and the original strings discarded. \n\nOrdering of a set is undefined and so half the test cases break because the string compare fails when i remove the if. \n\nFor extras i sorted() the extras set before converting to a string so at least it is stable and i guess i could do the same thing here?",
