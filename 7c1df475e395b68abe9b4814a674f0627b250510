      "message": "I\u0027m confused about the timing as well, I also don\u0027t understand why the bump in requirements isn\u0027t breaking in keystones CI jobs. I cannot deploy devstack at the moment without changing the requirements though. I see the error in devstack gate logs [1] but the operation continues through some sort of Zuul magic.\n\nI\u0027m not committed to removing passlib, the removal introduces a whole host of issues that we\u0027ll need to solve with older passwords that were hashed using passlib.  With it\u0027s maintenance status and however [2] is resolved we may need to look at removal, in which case we can work with the other users of passlib to remove the package.\n\nI\u0027m going to set this as a WIP while I investigate options.  Thanks for the feedback.\n\n[1]: https://zuul.opendev.org/t/openstack/build/d0b63f0f89634d23a2214d9c698bdb83/log/job-output.txt#12964\n[2]: https://foss.heptapod.net/python-libs/passlib/-/issues/187",
