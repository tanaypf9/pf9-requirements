(Or equally they didn\u0027t forget to pass blacklist to generate-constraints).\n\nHowever this is testing that something added to global-requirements is pinned.\n\nBut - I\u0027m not sure we need to make this an error, because:\n\n - if its not present, the periodic job that runs generate-constraints will add it for us.\n - projects using this can only add code using this in a narrow window - and they\u0027ll be pinned as soon as generate-constraints\u0027s proposed merge has come through.\n\nOTOH I don\u0027t think its harmful to check this *except* that you\u0027re also blacklisting pip, but I think that is a holdover from earlier versions, as pip is also in your hardcoded ignore list in constraints.py.",
