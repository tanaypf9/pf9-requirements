The ibm_db code has a c library which builds against the sql header files in the DB2 data server driver package.\n\nhttps://code.google.com/p/ibm-db/source/browse/IBM_DB/ibm_db/setup.py#38\n\nYou can get the DB2 10.5 data server driver package here:\n\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid\u003dswg27016878\n\nIt just needs to be extracted onto the target system and the IBM_DB_HOME environment variable needs to be pointing at it, e.g. IBM_DB_HOME\u003d/opt/ibm/db2/V10.5/clidriver.",
