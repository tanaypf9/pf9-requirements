# This script, when run from the root directory of this repository, will
# search the default and feature branches of all projects listed in the
# projects.txt file for declared dependencies, then output a list of any
# entries in the global-requirements.txt file which are not actual
# dependencies of those projects. Old dependencies which were removed
# from projects or which were used only for projects which have since
# been removed should be cleaned up, but many entries likely represent
# recent additions which still have pending changes to add them to one
# or more projects. In most cases, git pickaxe will yield the answer.

# Note(tonyb): Expand HEAD into something that's hopefully more human
#              readable
