    # NOTE(gmann): Update the nodeset if we move testing to the new version
    # of ubuntu. We are explicitly setting the nodeset here because the base
    # job (unittests) moving to the ubuntu latest version can break this
    # job on stable branch (as this job on stable branch will start running on
    # ubuntu latest version). This nodeset setting will avoid such breaking
    # on stable branch and make sure it continue to run on the supported ubuntu
    # version on stable branches.
