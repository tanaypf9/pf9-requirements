# NOTE(tonyb): Eventually this job will need access to the proposal_ssh_key
# secret so will need to live in project-config.  It's my understanding that
# as project-config is a trusted repo it's .impossible to speculatively
# execute jobs.  To aid job development I'm doing this in the requirements
