The commit message and the change don\u0027t mesh the commit message is all about ensuring that  2.1.2 isn\u0027t used on the stable/newton branch *BUT* the change moves the pin from 2.0.3 to 2.1.1.\n\nI looked and nova-lxd doesn\u0027t use constraints so this will be a noop and not resolve the bug.\n\n\nI\u0027ve created I9cea14812c1beb1491ec20587e1cfdec199a564e which I *think* is the correct solution assuming the nova-lxd team agree it\u0027ll need to be backported to stable/* (which I\u0027m happy to do) and *that* should resolve the issue\n\nHaving said that I\u0027m now even more confused as the nova-lxd gate seems to be working with pylxd\u003d\u003d2.1.2 [1]\n\n[1] http://logs.openstack.org/53/390953/3/check/gate-nova-lxd-python27-ubuntu-xenial/b03d244/tox/py27-3.log.txt",
