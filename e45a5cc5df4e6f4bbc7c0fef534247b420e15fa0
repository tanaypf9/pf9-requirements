      "message": "hey, yes glance_store tests are broken when using py-swiftclient. and yes 0.13.0 should work fine in production environments.\n\nThe catch here is though: if a CI system pulls in glance_store 0.13.0 and py-swiftclient 3.0.0 then it won\u0027t work in their respective downstream gates. This is rather sad as 0.13.0 is a published version for stable/mitaka and there\u0027s no upper cap on swiftclient requirement.\n\nTBH, I don\u0027t quite get what exactly you meant to say in the bottom two paragraphs. You want a keep a bug open for mitaka that indicates that global requirements are what they are currently and let the packagers know that 0.13.1 should be used in their CI system ??",
