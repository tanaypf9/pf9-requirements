      "message": "I think here you want to test that the project branch is the *same* stable branch as $BRANCH. That way we won\u0027t sync into the stable/juno branch for something that hasn\u0027t had a stable/kilo branch created, yet. I believe zuul (or something else in the chain) will try to check out the same branches of the projects and fall back to master when the branch doesn\u0027t exist, but I don\u0027t think we want to rely on that having happened correctly. Explicitly checking for equality here will be safer for local testing, for example.",
