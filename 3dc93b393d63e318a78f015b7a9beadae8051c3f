The detail here is entirely irrelevant to the requirements process: we don\u0027t particularly care how much, or how ready a user is of a proposed depedendency. We care solely about the questions from README :). So - I hope you didn\u0027t spend much time on this \u0027consuming projects\u0027 section, and in future changes I suggest you don\u0027t bother at all. Just \u0027we want this in keystone for CI\u0027 is *more* than sufficient (when combined with the other stuff below).",
