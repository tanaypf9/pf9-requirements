      "message": "It isn\u0027t strictly needed - older versions work fine. That said, if we just bump the lower bound in tooz then maybe we can just remove this from g-r? I know we started allowing projects to manage their own lower bounds so the requirements job shouldn\u0027t care about that. Although maybe it won\u0027t allow an entry that doesn\u0027t appear in g-r even if it\u0027s just a lower bound.\n\nThe upstream bug is https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/17478",
