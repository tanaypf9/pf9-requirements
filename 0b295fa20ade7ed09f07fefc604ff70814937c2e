      "message": "Yes, sorry that was a bit vague.\n\nObviously it\u0027s highly relevant to neutron.  Most immediately, I\u0027m using it in https://review.openstack.org/#/c/155631, although that specific change is still largely exploratory and has no formal blueprint as yet.\n\nRe dependency freeze: Yep - the above change is intended for Liberty (at best), I was just looking to have my jenkins tests pass so I can usefully continue development and review.  Does adding a new library to global-requirements automatically affect any existing projects, or only if those projects also explicitly add the new requirement?",
