Maybe one of the more active Cinder cores can weigh in on whether this is still tracked and tested somehow.",

      "message": "We should, but the note in that file suggests what I\u0027m doing here is correct:\n\n```\n# Document dependencies that are only used if using\n# certain drivers.  This file is not managed by\n# requirements tools.\n# check [extras] section of setup.cfg for versions.\n```\n\nAlso, we\u0027re missing a few dependencies here that are listed there:\n\n- `python-lefthandclient`\n- `pyxcli`\n- `infi.dtypes.wwn`\n- `infi.dtypes.iqn`\n\nSo if these are to stay here, we should probably add those and start checking `driver-requirements.txt` against machinery (but I don\u0027t think we should).",
