(Answer to this should be Yes, of course) Which?\n\nIf the library release is managed by the Openstack release process does it use the cycle-with-intermediary release type?\n\nDo we need to update anything else?\n\nFor further details please take a look to our documentation https://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/dependency-management.html#for-new-requirements\n\nThanks for your reading.\n\n",
