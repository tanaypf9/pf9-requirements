      "message": "I\u0027m ok with removing these from upper constraints, but I think they should stay in global requirements.  As the dependency management docs say, \"Global requirements gives us a single place where we can evaluate these things so that we can make a global decision for OpenStack on the suitability of the library.\"[0]\n\nSome of these driver-specific requirements are used by multiple projects, e.g., cinder and glance and manila, so I think it makes sense that these should be reviewed at a higher level than just the cinder project, for example.  Additionally, the projects (cinder, for example) when proposing to use a library, benefit from some review from the requirements team, and can backstop licensing issues and other red flags.\n\n\n[0] https://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/dependency-management.html",
