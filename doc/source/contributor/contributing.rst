So You Want to Contribute...
============================

For general information on contributing to OpenStack, please check out the
`contributor guide <https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/>`_ to get started.
It covers all the basics that are common to all OpenStack projects: the accounts
you need, the basics of interacting with our Gerrit review system, how we
communicate as a community, etc.

Below will cover the more project specific information you need to get started
with openstack/requirements.

We are on the #openstack-requirements channel on the Freenode IRC network.

Our meetings are currently Wednesdays at 2030 UTC.  See the
