I need access to the \u0027packages_distributions\u0027 function [1] which was only introduced in Python 3.10 [2] but which was backported to the importlib-metadata rolling backport in version 4.4 of that library. Given this, it sounds like this is now the same situation as we faced with mock (the library) and we should use the same resolution, right?\n\n[1] https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/cliff/+/842350/\n[2] https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.metadata.html#package-distributions\n[3] https://github.com/python/importlib_metadata#compatibility",
