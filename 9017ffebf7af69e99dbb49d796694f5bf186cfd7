      "message": "\u003e Patch Set 1:\n\u003e \n\u003e the way I understand the discussion at the time is that we\u0027d start using the builtin python version\n\nThat would make sense if we weren\u0027t expecting importlib-metadata to change, however, they\u0027re still introducing features into this library that we\u0027d like to use. I need access to the \u0027packages_distributions\u0027 function [1] which was only introduced in Python 3.10 [2] but which was backported to the importlib-metadata rolling backport in version 4.4 of that library. Given this, it sounds like this is now the same situation as we faced with mock (the library) and we should use the same resolution, right?\n\n[1] https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/cliff/+/842350/\n[2] https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.metadata.html#package-distributions\n[3] https://github.com/python/importlib_metadata#compatibility",

      "message": "IIUC just drop it manually, once it is no longer in g-r, it shouldn\u0027t get re-added. But the removal also isn\u0027t automated, afaict. Or maybe the next proposal bot run would do it? But I think it is better to do it in a single patch.\n\nBtw. the failure I posted is more due to running with master constraints on bionic, which no longer will work. The cleanup in this patch still seems to be sane regardless of that.",
