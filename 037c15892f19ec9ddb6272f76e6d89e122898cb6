      "message": "Seeing that this new library is an OSC plugin, but not within OpenStack governance, I have even more concerns about making it required globally, since we have to ensure that no namespace collisions occur for OSC commands and that the common standards for OSC plugins are being followed. Adding sdks PTL to chime in on this.",

Having official project depend on unofficial one-man tool, which claims to be OpenStack related but not under OpenStack seems really weird. Though I am not going to block that from OSC/SDK side",

      "message": "Although the library is currently developed by single engineer, it is not a one-man-show project. It is a part or bigger initiative to make autoscaling work with Prometheus instead of Gnocchi. As I wrote above, I will abandon this review now and revive it once the project is more acceptable as hard dependency.",
