We shouldn\u0027t need to add this constraint in global-requirements.\n\nIt is also very difficult to remove these constraints once newer versions are available, so it should be avoided as much as possible.\n\nMaybe if your commit message actually stated what/why this is being done it would help, but with upper-constraints this shouldn\u0027t be needed.",
