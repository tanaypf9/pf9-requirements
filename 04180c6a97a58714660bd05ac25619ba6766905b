Friday afternoon it was still working...",

Reverting this is easy but we have to understand the problems, otherwise we are fully stuck with the current versions IMO.\n\nFor the issue with ansible-lint, I\u0027d suggest you bump ansible-lint to v6.22.0 which contains https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint/commit/824d58fc35c63e413ed0f0a97976e3949d934eae",

Note that bump of django version was also recently merged[1] and that can theoretically affect horizon.\n\nWe probably have to check if this revert actually resolves the problem in kolla (does depends-on magic works ?) or hold the node to dig into the problem.\n\n[1] https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/requirements/+/904202",
