Reverting this is easy but we have to understand the problems, otherwise we are fully stuck with the current versions IMO.\n\nFor the issue with ansible-lint, I\u0027d suggest you bump ansible-lint to v6.22.0 which contains https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint/commit/824d58fc35c63e413ed0f0a97976e3949d934eae",
