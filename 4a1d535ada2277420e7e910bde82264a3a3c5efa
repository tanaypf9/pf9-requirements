Going back to 1.18.0 is actually dropping a lot of releases that have been used fine up until now.\n\nThe mention of stable/rocky is a little confusing too. The upper-constraint for stable/rocky was actually limited to 1.18.0, so rocky should not be affected by this either way:\n\nhttps://opendev.org/openstack/requirements/src/branch/stable/rocky/upper-constraints.txt#L59",
