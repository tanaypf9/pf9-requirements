      "message": "Raven is deprecated, please update oslo.log to use sentry-sdk[1] instead.  There\u0027s a handy migration guide[2]\n\nAs an incentive I\u0027ll start answering the common questions:\n\nIs the library actively maintained?\n\nWe really want some indication that the library is something we can get support on if we or our users find a bug, and that we donâ€™t have to take over and fork the library.\n\nPointers to recent activity upstream and a consistent release model are appreciated.\n\n----\nIs the library good code?                  Yes\nIs the library python 3 compatible?        Yes\nIs the library license compatible?         Yes BSD\nIs the library already packaged in the distros we target (Ubuntu latest / Fedora latest)?                                   No\nIs the function of this library already covered by other libraries in global-requirements.txt?                          No\nIs the library required for OpenStack project or related dev or infrastructure setup? (Answer to this should be Yes, of course) Which?     Yes [ oslo.log ]\n\nPlease provide details such as gerrit change request or launchpad bug/blueprint specifying the need for adding this library.\n                                           ??????\n\nIf the library release is managed by the Openstack release process does it use the cycle-with-intermediary release type?      N/A\n\nThis is needed to ensure that updated releases that consume requirements updates are available for integration/coninstallability tests with other projects.\n                                           Yes\n\nDo I need to update anything else?         Nossssssssssssssssssssssssssss\n----\n\n[1] https://pypi.org/project/sentry-sdk/\n[2] https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/migration/",
