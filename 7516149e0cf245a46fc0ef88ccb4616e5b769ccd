      "message": "Matt, in the future, Castellan will be used to replace the basic key manager interfaces in Nova and Cinder (original key manager interfaces were merged https://review.openstack.org/#/c/30973/ and https://review.openstack.org/#/c/39292/).  Once Castellan is in global requirements, other projects may use it as a key manager interface for use for encryption.  Other projects that have expressed interest are Sahara and Swift.",
