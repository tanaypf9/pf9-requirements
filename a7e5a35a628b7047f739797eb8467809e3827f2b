      "message": "I does have a huge meaning because it allows us to specify python executables without full paths, full paths are not portable as python versions can be installed in various places, even the system ones (not to mention user level installed ones, like pyenv).\n\nThe previous code `os.path.exists(python):` was forcing use of only fully-qualified paths, nothing else would have worked.\n\nEspecially for our purpose (generate) we do not care much where the python executable comes from, but we care about its version, which is in the filename anyway. Change is also backwards compatible without any side-effects.",
